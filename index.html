                Financial literacy is the key to becoming financially independent. To be financially literate is to know how to manage 
                your money. This means learning how to pay your bills, how to borrow and save money responsibly, and how and why to 
                invest and plan for retirement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take the initiative to self-educate and grow your financial knowledge, by beginning with the basics of money management 
                and maturing into a smart spender. Putting time into your financial development improves saving and investing decisions.

                Paying down your debt faster may help you get a head start on your goals, whether it&apos;s applying for new credit, saving on the 
                cost of borrowing, or just reducing your debt. Here are some strategies to think about when considering repayment plans that 
                could help you pay your debt off faster.

            <h2>Tips for paying off debt</h2>
            <div id="tips-to-pay-off-debt">
                <ol id="ordered-list">
                    <li>Pay more than the minimum</li>
                        <p>
                            Pay off your debt and save on interest by paying more than the minimum every month. The key is to make extra payments 
                            consistently so you can pay off your loan more quickly. Some lenders allow you to make an extra payment each month 
                            specifying that each extra payment goes toward the principal. Before you begin, check the terms of your loan to determine 
                            whether additional fees or prepayment penalties may apply.
                        </p>
                    <li>Pay more than once a month</li>
                        <p>
                            Pay your credit card bills more than the required once per month. This may make it easier to stay on track of how much you 
                            owe. Paying your credit card bill regularly may also lower your balance/utilization ratio. The credit utilization ratio is 
                            the percentage of your total available credit that is currently being used. The utilization ratio is one of the components 
                            used by credit reporting agencies to calculate your credit score.
                        </p>
                    <li>Pay off your most expensive loan first</li>
                        <p>
                            Your most expensive loan is the loan with the highest interest rate. By paying it off first, you&apos;re reducing the overall 
                            amount of interest you pay and decreasing your overall debt. Then, continue paying down debts with the next highest interest 
                            rates to save on your overall cost. This is sometimes referred to as the “avalanche method” of paying down debt.
                        </p>
                    <li>Consider the snowball method of paying off debt</li>
                        <p>
                            This involves starting with your smallest balance first, paying that off and then rolling that same payment towards the next 
                            smallest balance as you work your way up to the largest balance.  This method can help you build momentum as each balance is 
                            paid off. Understand the pros and cons of this debt pay down strategy by reviewing the Snowball versus Avalanche methods of 
                            paying down debt.
                        </p>
                    <li>Keep track of bills and pay them in less time.</li>
                        <p>
                            Stay on top of your debt by using bill reminders and Online Bill Pay. Simply schedule the amounts you want to pay and when 
                            you want to pay them. You can also set up payment reminders and receive eBills from payees offering electronic billing.

                        A credit score can be a strong indicator of your financial well-being. There&apos;s a number of credit bureaus that assign 
                        scores ranging from 300 (high risk) to 850 (low risk). The bureaus determine scores based on a group of factors which 
                        reflect your spending habits (how often you borrow, how quickly you repay and how much you owe).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Building a high credit score can help you get approval for low-interest loans, credit cards, mortgages, and car payments. 
                        When you are looking to move into an apartment or get a new job, your credit history may be a deciding factor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, making late payments on bills, missing payments, piling on debts and regularly maxing out your credit 
                        card can result in seriously lowering your credit score. Just as an excellent score can give you access to loans, jobs 
                        and more, a low credit score can prevent you from being able to borrow more, pay low interest rates and even get certain jobs.

                    <li>Build your credit history</li>
                        <p>
                            Having little or no credit history can make it difficult for companies to assess you, and your credit score may be lower 
                            as a result. This is a common problem for young people and people who are new to the country. Luckily, there are some 
                            steps you may be able to take to build up your credit history
                        </p>
                    <li>Make regular payments on time</li>
                        <p>
                            Paying your accounts on time and in full each month is a good way to show lenders you&apos;re a reliable borrower, and 
                            capable of handling credit responsibly. Old, well-managed accounts will usually improve your score &hyphen; although be 
                            sure to read about the potential impact of unused credit cards.
                        </p>
                    <li>Keep your credit utilization low</li>
                        <p>
                            Your credit utilization is the percentage you use of your credit limit. For example, if you have a limit of £2,000 and 
                            you&apos;ve used R1,000 of that, your credit utilization is 50%. Usually, a lower percentage will be seen positively by 
                            lenders, and will increase your credit score as a result. If possible, try and keep your credit utilization below 30%.
                        </p>
                    <li>Check for errors and report any mistakes on your report</li>  
                        <p>
                            Even small mistakes, such as a mistyped address, can affect your score and could be enough for a lender to refuse you 
                            credit. It&apos;s worth checking your credit report to make sure all the information on it is accurate and up to date.
                        <p>
                        <p>
                            If you do spot a mistake, contact the provider directly and ask them to change it. If you need help, we can raise a 
                            dispute with them on your behalf. If there is negative information that is correct but occurred during special circumstances 
                            (such as a period in hospital or losing your job) you can ask us to add a Notice of Correction to your credit report 
                            explaining this.
                        </p>
                    <li>Monitor your credit file for fraudulent activity</li>
                        <p>
                            If fraudsters gain access to your personal details, they could take out credit in your name without you being aware. 
                            If you see something on your credit report that is wrong, such as an application you don&apos;t recognise, Experian&apos;s

                    <li>Keep old accounts open and show a long credit history</li>
                        <p>
                            It can be good to show lenders that you can successfully manage multiple credit accounts, especially over a long period of 
                            time. Most credit scoring models tend to reward you for having long-standing, mature credit accounts, and for only using a 
                            small portion of your credit limit. For more information, see our guide on what to do with unused credit cards.

                    One of the first building blocks of a successful personal finance plan is the ability to budget. Budgeting 
                    requires that you analyze and, likely, change your spending habits. Instead of your money controlling you, 
                    you control your money. Develop habits to save, avoid financial crisis and maintain peace of mind.

            <h1>Some steps:</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Start tracking your monthly expenses</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In a notebook or a mobile app, write in every time you spend money. Be diligent about this, 
                            because it&apos;s easy to forget. This is the foundation for your budget.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Identify fixed and variable expenses</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Fixed expenses are ones that you have every month: rent, mortgage, car payment, electricity, 
                            bill, water bill, student loan payment. Variable expenses are costs that go up and down each 
                            month and ones that come and go &hyphen; groceries, pet supplies, haircuts, concert tickets, 
                            etc.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Add up the totals</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            After three months, calculate how much you are spending, on average, per month. And look at 
                            the categories.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Study your variable expenses</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This is where most people tend to overspend. Decide what gives you the most pleasure from 
                            these monthly expenses that you feel these costs are worthwhile? And which ones can you 
                            really do without? Be honest, and start cutting. This is the beginning of the hard 
                            decisions.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Factor in savings</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A key part of budgeting is that you should always pay yourself first. That is, you should 
                            take a portion of every paycheck and put it into savings. This one practice, if you can make 
                            it a habit, will pay dividends (literally in many cases) throughout your life.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Now set your budget</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Start making the necessary cuts in your fixed and variable expenses. Decide what you want to 
                            save every week or every two weeks. The leftover money is how much you have to live on.
